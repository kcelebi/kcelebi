## Hi, I'm Kaya! 👋

I am a 2nd-year student at Duke University double-majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. I've been programming since the 7th grade and am incredibly impassioned with topics relating to machine learning, computer network architectures, and quantum computing. I truly care about the opportunities to create products with meaningful applications using the powerful tools of Computer Science. Feel free to explore my past and ongoing projects! 

## Ongoing Projects 🧿

Here are a list of ongoing projects that will be updated frequently both on GitHub and on my <a href = "https://kayacelebi17.wixsite.com/website">website</a>. I expect the highest volume of updates to come during December 2020-January 2021. 

### Car V2 🚗

Version 1 of this project involved simulating traffic and collecting the congestion data. Version 2 of this project involves translating traffic into a max-flow networking problem, and trying to create an optimal solution by adding a new road. Currently, I am using linear programming combined with machine learning to solve this problem. 

### Cellular Automata 🔬

Overall the ``Cellular-Automata`` repo has no direct goal. My plans for the next edition of it are to create an interactive website to test and create different models with Conway's Game of Life, and also to create a massive dataset for different rules of Cellular Automata. 

#### Conway's Game of Life Interactive

I am currently in the process of implementing an interactive demonstration where one can draw different pre-set patterns to a Game of Life simulation. The goal of this is to allow the user the ease of making new patterns, observing simulations of natural phenomena, or discovering new features.

#### Cellular Automata Dataset

Conway's Game of Life is not the only set of rules for Cellular Automata. I want to bridge some of my focus to other rules, such as rule 30, and perhaps create a dataset for the purpose of analyzing the different patterns that appear. This project is still in the planning stage, but expect updates by December 2020. 

### DJI-VXX 📈

The current version of this project is a model that can predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Volatility Index based on Wall Street Journal news headlines. My plan for the next edition of this project is to make an auto-trader that operates solely on a more refined version of this model.
