## Hi, I'm Kaya! 👋

I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science and Statistics student at Duke University. I am an REU research student in Columbia University's EE department in the WiMNet Lab as well as a research intern in Duke ECE's lab. Feel free to explore my past and ongoing projects! 

## Ongoing Projects 🗺

Here are a list of ongoing projects that will be updated frequently on GitHub.

### riscv-assembler Python Package ([Documentation](https://www.riscvassembler.org)) ⚙️

This is a Python package that is currently [available to use](https://github.com/kcelebi/riscv-assembler). The package provides tools for converting RISC-V Assembly to machine code. It has some useful tools such as converting whole files into machine code as well as analyzing individual instructions. While a version is currently up and running on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/riscv-assembler/), I continue to update it and add more features. Check it out and let me know how it works and if it needs something extra!

### DJI-VXX 📈

A regression model that can predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Volatility Index based on Wall Street Journal news headlines. [Check out the updates here](https://github.com/kcelebi/DJI-VXX)

### Flight Analysis 🛩

Package that scrapes and analyzes flight data from Google Flights. Key feature is picking the optimal flight for you based on constraints such as time, place, and price. Allows for tools to easily analyze this flight data and apply pre-trained models for better interpretation.[Check out the updates here](https://github.com/kcelebi/Flight_Analysis)
