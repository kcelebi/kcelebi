## Hi, I'm Kaya! 👋

I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science and Statistics student at Duke University. I am also an REU student in Columbia University's EE department in the WiMNet Lab. Feel free to explore my past and ongoing projects! 

## Ongoing Projects 🗺

Here are a list of ongoing projects that will be updated frequently on GitHub.

### riscv-assembler Python Package ([Documentation](https://www.riscvassembler.org)) ⚙️

This is a Python package that is currently [available to use](https://github.com/kcelebi/riscv-assembler). The package provides tools for converting RISC-V Assembly to machine code. It has some useful tools such as converting whole files into machine code as well as analyzing individual instructions. While a version is currently up and running on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/riscv-assembler/), I continue to update it and add more features. Check it out and let me know how it works and if it needs something extra!

### Traffic-V2 🚗

Version 1 of this project involved simulating traffic and collecting the congestion data. Version 2 of this project involves reducing traffic into a max-flow networking problem. [Check out V1](https://github.com/kcelebi/Traffic-V1)

### DJI-VXX 📈

A regression model that can predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Volatility Index based on Wall Street Journal news headlines. [Check out the updates here](https://github.com/kcelebi/DJI-VXX)

### Pocket Planes ✈️

Simulation of iPhone game Pocket Planes using different AI algorithms to play it.[Check out the updates here](https://github.com/kcelebi/pocket-planes)

### Map Maker 

Simple GUI to generate cartesian coordinates of cities on a chosen 2D-map. This is opposed to transforming Long,Lat coordinates to a non-standard cartesian map. [Check out the updates here](https://github.com/kcelebi/map-maker)
