## Hi, I'm Kaya! 👋

A little about me, I am a:
- **Data Scientist at Hartree Partners**, an Energy & Commodities Trading Firm
- **Co-Founder of CG Group**, an AI-native Defense Contracting platform automating Supply Chain and Government Procurement
- **Computer Science (M.Sc) student at Columbia University**, graduate from Duke University with a dual degree in Computer Science and Statistical Science (B.Sc)

I have a passion for solving complex business or technical problems with creative, data-driven solutions. With extensive experience in finance, technology, and academia, I've built machine learning models, pipelines, and tools that have real-world impact, from optimizing trading platforms to solving supply chain to enhancing network performance.

I’m constantly exploring new ways to leverage unstructured data and machine learning to develop interesting solutions. Feel free to explore my projects below and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
