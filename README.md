## Hi, I'm Kaya! ðŸ‘‹

A little about me, I am a:
- **Data Scientist at Hartree Partners**, an Energy & Commodities Trading Firm
- **Co-Founder of CG Defense Consulting**, a Defense Contracting Firm automating Supply Chain and Government Procurement
- **Computer Science (M.S) student at Columbia University**, graduate from Duke University with a dual degree in Computer Science and Statistical Science (B.S)

I have a passion for solving complex business or technical problems with creative, data-driven solutions. With extensive experience in finance, technology, and academia, I've built machine learning models, pipelines, and tools that have real-world impact, from optimizing trading platforms to solving supply chain to enhancing network performance.

Iâ€™m constantly exploring new ways to leverage unstructured data and machine learning to develop interesting solutions. Feel free to explore my projects below and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
