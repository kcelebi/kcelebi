## Hi, I'm Kaya! üëã

CS and Stats at Duke University. Favorite topics are machine learning, computer network architectures, x86 and ARM ISA's, quantitative finance, quantum computing, and mathematics. I truly care about the opportunities to create products with meaningful applications using the powerful tools of Computer Science. Feel free to explore my past and ongoing projects! 

## Ongoing Projects üó∫

Here are a list of ongoing projects that will be updated frequently both on GitHub and on my <a href = "https://kayacelebi17.wixsite.com/website">website</a>.

### riscv-assembler Python Package ‚öôÔ∏è

This is a Python package that is currently [available to use](https://github.com/kcelebi/riscv-assembler). The package provides tools for converting RISC-V Assembly to machine code. It has some useful tools such as converting whole files into machine code as well as analyzing individual instructions. While a version is currently up and running on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/riscv-assembler/), I continue to update it and add more features. Check it out and let me know how it works and if it needs something extra!

### Traffic-V2 üöó

Version 1 of this project involved simulating traffic and collecting the congestion data. Version 2 of this project involves translating traffic into a max-flow networking problem, and trying to create an optimal solution by adding a new road. Currently, I am using linear programming combined with machine learning to solve this problem.

### Cellular Automata üî¨

Overall the ``Cellular-Automata`` repo has no direct goal. My plans for the next edition of it are to create an interactive website to test and create different models with Conway's Game of Life, and also to create a massive dataset for different rules of Cellular Automata.

### DJI-VXX üìà

The current version of this project is a model that can predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Volatility Index based on Wall Street Journal news headlines. My plan for the next edition of this project is to make an auto-trader that operates solely on a more refined version of this model.
